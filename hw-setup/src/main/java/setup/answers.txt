1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    The getFibTerm() method treated 0 as a negative number, but the FibonacciTest didn't.
    Change the precondition for the IllegalArgumentException from n <= 0 to n < 0.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    Didn't change anything, because I already fixed precondition for the IllegalArgumentException.
    So, getFibTerm() returns 1 when 0 <= n <= 2.

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

    getFibTerm(2) expected:<2> but was:<1>, the getFibTerm() method returned 1 if 0 <= n <= 2.
    So let it return 1 when 0 <= n <= 1.
    And return getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2) when 1 < n.
