# Test addNode method in a single graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add different nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add a duplicated node
failed to add node n1 to graph1

# List its node
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3

# List child for n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are:

# Check contains() method.
graph1 contains n1: true
graph1 contains n4: false
