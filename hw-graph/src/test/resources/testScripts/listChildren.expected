# List children for bides that have 0, 1 and 2 children node.

# Create graphs
created graph graph

# Add 3 node to graph
added node n0 to graph
added node n1 to graph
added node n2 to graph

# Add one child for n1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph

# Add two children for n2
added edge e0 from n2 to n0 in graph
added edge e1 from n2 to n1 in graph

# n0 lists children
the children of n0 in graph are:

# n1 lists children
the children of n1 in graph are: n2(e2)

# n2 lists children
the children of n2 in graph are: n0(e0) n1(e1)
