# Test addEdge method between multiple nodes in a single graph

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add different nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1

# Add different edges between two fixed nodes.
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Add the same edges in reverse order.
added edge e1 from n2 to n1 in graph1
added edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Add duplicated edges.
failed to add edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
failed to add edge e2 from n2 to n1 in graph1

# Add a edge from the node to itself.
added edge e3 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Add a edge between non-exist nodes.

# Add more edges between those nodes.
added edge e4 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e1 from n3 to n2 in graph1

# List child for n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e3) n2(e1) n2(e2) n3(e4)
