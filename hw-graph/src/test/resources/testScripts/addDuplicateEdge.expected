# Test addEdge duplicate edge

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 2 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add different edges between n1 and n2.
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Add duplicate edges between n1 and n2.
failed to add edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
